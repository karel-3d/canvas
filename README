Canvas (or glib) is a projct for c++ lessons.

It does nothing great and therefore you shouldn't really be interested.

If you still are, go ahead and look around. It's under BSD licence, altought it's not written anywhere except this file.

The comments are mostly in Czech, sorry.

The object methids are sometimes logically divided into CONSTRUCTOR, GETTER, SETTER, that doesn't mean the methods in GETTERS are "traditional" getters/setters, it's just to divide it into cathegories that returns something / set something.
